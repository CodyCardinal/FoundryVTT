# FoundryVTT Macros and Scripts

I'm an avid D&D and table top RPG Enjoyer. 
Foundry's Virtual Tabletop is a Javascript webapp that allows folks to play these games online.
This is just a collection of some of the scripts and automation I found were needed. 
Updates will come for whatever I'm working on for whichever game I'm in.
